# Subtype Descriptions for Kmeans PC2:20

Analysis of the subtypes produced by Kmeans clustering on PC2:20, identifying and
explaining the characteristics of each.

## A - Alanine

## C - Cysteine

Summary:

* C1 - Hydrophobic
* C2 - Permissive positions
* C3 - Disulphide bonding
* C4 - Aromatic (and Hydrophobic)

There appear to be three physical factors involved - disulphide bonding, hydrophobicity
and potentially aromatic-sulphur interactions.
Each appears dominant in a particular subtype, although not restricted to it
(e.g. 1 C4 position is involved in a disulphide bond).

C4 positions tend to be buried within the protein and often adjacent to an aromatic
residue (can also be seen in the surface accessibility/chemical environment).

* Src 501 - In a helix bundle surrounded by hydrophobic residues, with an aromatic nearby but not adjacent
* TEM1 75 - Also in a bundle and near an aromatic ring, but also one half of a disulphide bond (the other half is not in C4)
* MAPK1 216 - Buried and near an aromatic
* MAPK1 161 - Exterior but near an aromatic
* MAPK1 166 - In an apparent binding cleft, appears to conjugate the bound molecule in this structure (which is aromatic), but is also a modified residue in the crystal structure
* ADRB2 327 - Semi-buried residue near hydrophobic residues and an aromatic
* TPMT 133 - Residue is on the exterior but the side chain faces inwards into a hydrophobic pocket
* UBE2I 43/75 - Near each other in 3D space, both side chains face into the protein and there are hydrophobic and aromatic residues nearby, although not directly conjugating like in some examples.
* APH3II - 3 residues, FoldX not run on correct structure yet
