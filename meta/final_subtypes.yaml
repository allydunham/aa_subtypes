desc: "Final subtypes assembly \
       The final subtypes set is assembled by combining two runs, \
       both using hybrid dynamic treecutting on the dendrogram produced \
       by hierarchical clustering. The cosine distance is used along with \
       filtering positions where all |ER| < 0.4. Two runs are combined with \
       deepSplit treecutting parameters chosen varying for each AA, as below."
