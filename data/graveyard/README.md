# Graveyard data

Datasets which have been partially or fully processed but deemed unstuitable for the analysis.

## Datasets:
* wagenaar\_2014\_braf: Tested for variants that provide resistance to Vemurafenib in V600E Braf, 
    which is not related to well to normal protein fitness. Indeed we find a weak anticorrelation 
    with, for example, SIFT scores.

* adkar\_2012\_ccdb: Tested based on minimum expression leading to cell death, which isn't easy 
    to convert to normal fitness

* nodagarcia\_2019\_gdh: Tested a large number of conditions, with very different fitness properties, 
    which is challenging to integrate.
