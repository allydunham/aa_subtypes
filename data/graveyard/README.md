# Graveyard data

Datasets which have been partially or fully processed but deemed unstuitable for the analysis

## Datasets:
* wagenaar\_2014\_braf: Tested for variants that provide resistance to Vemurafenib in V600E Braf, 
    which is not related to well to normal protein fitness. Indeed we find a weak anticorrelation 
    with, for example, SIFT scores.
