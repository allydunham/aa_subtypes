# Structures and Models from SwissMODEL

These protein structure PDB files were sourced from [SwissMODEL](swissmodel.expasy.org).
The model or structure chosen for each protein is documented in `meta/structures.yaml`,
which gives the template ID chosen for each protein and the type of structure model (x-ray
crystalography, homology model etc.). The Uniprot ID of each protein is available in 
the study YAML config. Those proteins denoated as "model" are homology models from
SwissMODEL ([CC BY-SA 4.0 Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://swissmodel.expasy.org/docs/terms_of_use)) 
while the others are experimental structures from the PDB, as cited in the references.
